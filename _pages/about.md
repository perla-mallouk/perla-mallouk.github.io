PhD student under the supervision of [Julie Delon](https://judelo.github.io/) and [Agnès Desolneux](https://desolneux.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).

I study Optimal Transport, in particular Generalised Wasserstein Barycentres, the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and GMM-restricted OT. 

After my studies at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (cycle
ingénieur), I took the [Masters in Mathematics, Vision and
Learning](https://www.master-mva.com/) ("MVA" in French), where I took [Gabriel
Peyré](http://www.gpeyre.com/)'s "Optimal Transport" course. Enthralled, I took
a project on [A Wasserstein distance between
GMMs](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02178204v4/document). This led me to
an internship with Julie Delon and [Rémi
Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com/index.fr.html) on [Generalised Wasserstein
Barycentres](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09755.pdf). This internship finished in
September 2022, and I am now continuing this work and branching back to GMM-OT
and Sliced Wasserstein during my PhD.
